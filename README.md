## About

Our project is a website that serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions on various topics. It works on a reward-based system where users who provide helpful answers are eligible for receiving tokens based on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. The website is similar to Quora but with the added incentive of earning tokens. The website has a user-friendly interface and provides various features like asking and answering questions, upvoting and liking questions, searching for specific topics, and a user profile page. The platform's main aim is to provide a community-driven space where users can share their knowledge and earn rewards in return.
